Dave,

Attached is the update to CRMFLX, version 2.3.  The code change was 
extremely minor, placing output from the magnetosphere initialization 
routine (MSPINIT) under the SAVE statement in the main routine 
CRMFLX.  This code change should fix the problem you encountered when 
output from CRMFLX for a second series of radiation event 
calculations became corrupted after the initial series of 
calculations were followed by other (non-radiation) events.

For my configuration control purposes, I have attached the entire 
source code for CRMFLX V23, but the only routine affected is the main 
routine, CRMFLX.

I cannot duplicate the memory problem on my computer to verify the 
fix to your problem, so please let me know if there are any problems.

Regards,

Bill Blackwell
