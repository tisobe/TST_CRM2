<b>GEOPACK corrections/updates:</b>
<p>

August 29, 1997:  Subroutine RECALC: a correction was made to the calculation
of the quantity DJ (lines #176-177). The earlier version of the FORTRAN code
contained a bug, which resulted in a small (less than 4*10^-7 degrees) error
in the calculated orientation of Earth's rotation axis. Owing to the extremely
small magnitude of the error, its effect can be ignored in all applications.
(Note that the angles returned by the subroutine SUN are accurate within
a margin of 6*10^-3 degrees, i.e., 4 orders of magnitude wider).

Thanks are due to Dr. A. Petrukovich (IKI, Moscow) for pointing out the
mistake.

July 15, 1999:  Subroutine RECALC:  in the comment line (#30), the input
parameter ISEC was erroneously referred to as "seconds of day" . Its actual
meaning is SECONDS OF MINUTE.  The correction was prompted by courtesy of
Drs. S. Petrinec (Univ. of Washington), G. Le, and Prof. C. T. Russell (IGPP UCLA).

January 5, 2001.   An update of the GEOPACK has been made, including an
extension of the IGRF and RECALC subroutines (main field coefficients for
the epoch 2000 were added); for more details, see comments preceding the
FORTRAN subroutine listings.

<p>

April 3, 2001.  Subroutine RECALC (updated version):  lines 98-99 should read
<p>
  <pre>
        ELSEIF (IY.LT.2000) THEN                        !1995-2000
           F2=(FLOAT(IY)+FLOAT(IDAY)/365.-1995.)/5.

In the earlier version, the last term in the parentheses (second line) was
incorrectly specified as 1990.  (Courtesy of Dr. Scott Boardsen, RITSS Corp.)

<b>T01_01 model code corrections/updates:</b>
<p>
February 13, 2002. In some cases with abnormally low values of the solar wind
pressure, the previous version of the model code crashed at low altitudes,
due to inaccurate scaling of the Birkeland currents. In the corrected version,
the problem has been eliminated. Courtesy of Dr. Mattias Foerster, (Max-Planck
Institute, Germany).
