Rob and Ken,

Because there is currently no MSFC FTP site with anonymous access, I have
placed Bill Blackwell's new CRMFLX database files on lucky in
/home/mnewhouse.  You will find the following files:

 - magnetosheath and magnetosphere datafiles (XYZmap_MagSph_ACE_Limit.prot
and XYZmap_MagSheath_ACE_Limit.prot)
 - conversion routines (MSPA2B_MAP.f and MSHA2B_MAP.f)
 - verification routines (MSPH_Verify23_B.txt and MSHE_Verify23_B.txt)

As usual, you will need to compile and run the conversion routines to
convert the ASCII data files to binary.  Then compile and link to the
verification routines to CRMFLX 2.3, and run the program to verify correct
binary file conversion.  The binary file conversion process was successfl on
our system, and both the ASCII and binary versions of these files will be
included with the OFLS delivery, along with the database files delivered
previously with CRMFLX 2.3.

I have attached a description from Bill of the new databases and their
differences from the databases delivered with CRMFLX 2.3.  If you have any
questions about the databases or their verification, please contact Bill at
(256) 544-6741.  If you have any problems accessing the files, please
contact me at (256) 885-7238.

Subject: RE: New CRMFLX 2.3 Database

Dear Rob et al.,

We recommend using the new database for CRMFLX 2.3.  It differs from the
previous database in that it uses only data from periods of low solar-proton
flux [ACE EPAM-P3 < 100 p/(cm^2 s sr MeV)]. Thus, the solar-proton flux
needs to be added back in, as described in Bill Blackwell's note.  For now,
the recommended combinations are these:
Region 1 (Solar wind): Solar protons only
Region 2 (Magnetosheath): Kp-driven CRM + 2 X Solar protons
Region 3 (Magnetosphere): Kp-driven CRM + (1/2) X Solar protons

Regards,
Steve
