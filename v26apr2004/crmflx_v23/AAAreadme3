Rob & Marilyn,

Attached are source files for updating to CRMFLX Ver. 2.2 
(Experimental).  In addition to the source file (CRMFLX_V22_EXP.f), I 
have included two include files (BLEND.PAR and MAXNSPHVOL.PAR).  The 
stubby driver used to verify that you are using the correct versions 
of the code and database (MSPH_Verify22.f) is also attached.

There are significant upgrades to the code from Version 2.1.  Please 
note that there is a minor change to the interface, with the addition 
of the variable IUSEMSP:

C       IUSEMSP - flag for control of magnetosphere flux calculation:
C          IUSEMSP = 0 if only the magnetosphere model flux is used.
C          IUSEMSP = 1 if user supplied uniform solar wind flux value
C                      is added to the magnetosphere flux.
C          IUSEMSP = 2 if analytic solar wind model (uniform flux) is
C                      added to the magnetosphere flux.

Code verification runs showed that CRM2 output in the open field line 
(lobe) regions of the magnetotail did not order up well as a function 
of Kp.  Fluence plots with a wide range of Kp values showed the lines 
frequently crossing each other.  Kp scaling laws are now used, as 
well as reintroduced z-layer bins  controlling the near-neighbor 
search when the spacecraft is in the tail.

Numerous comparisons made between this latest version of CRMFLX 
(CRM2) and the original release (CRM1, with the smaller database) 
show that there are differences as expected.  CRM2's flux profile has 
a lower flux region associated with the lobe regions, and there is a 
slight increase in the flux in the smaller geocentric range regions. 
However, the net effect on the fluence integrated over an orbit is 
usually not large.  Most orbits examined show that the difference is 
less than 50%.

I initially had concerns over increasing the runtime of CRM2 by 
adding more computational load.  However, by cleaning up and 
optimizing the code, it looks as though runtime performance is 
holding up well.

Please let me know if errors or problems are found.

Regards,

Bill Blackwell
